<p>TO INSURE healthful living, domestic wastes must be disposed of.
Primitive wanderers and too often present-day tourists deposit
their wastes promiscuously and move on when the surroundings become
foul. This is impractical in built-up communities. Therefore,
in most cities and in some rural areas sanitary codes regulate the
disposal of wastes.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_SEWAGE" id="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_SEWAGE">CHARACTERISTICS OF SEWAGE</a></h2>


<p>Household sewage ordinarily consists principally of human excrement,
toilet paper, garbage, dish water, and other wash water from
the various plumbing fixtures and floor drains.</p>

<p>Many kinds of bacteria, at times disease-producing ones, are contained
in the discharges from the human body. Epidemics of typhoid
fever, dysentery, diarrhea, cholera, and other water-borne diseases may
result from the pollution of the water supply with sewage. Pollution
is carried by water moving underground, as well as by water flowing
on the surface. This is especially true in limestone regions, where
underground channels and rock crevices permit water to flow for considerable
distances with little filtering action. Sewage used for fertilizing
or irrigating crops<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> may contaminate vegetables or the udders of
cows and thus spread disease. Anthrax, cholera, and parasitic worms
may be present in the surface drainage from fields and barn lots. It is
wise to regard all sewage as dangerous and to dispose of it promptly in
a sanitary manner, so that disease germs will not pollute the water
supplies or be spread by flies, animals, or man.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> This subject is discussed at length in Technical Bulletin 675, Sewage Irrigation
as Practiced in the Western States.</p>

<h2><a name="PROTECTION_OF_WATER_SOURCES_FROM_HOUSEHOLD_WASTES" id="PROTECTION_OF_WATER_SOURCES_FROM_HOUSEHOLD_WASTES">PROTECTION OF WATER SOURCES FROM HOUSEHOLD WASTES</a></h2>


<p>Under most farm conditions a safe place for the disposal of wastes
is in the upper 3-foot layer of soil, where the action of bacteria tends
to render it harmless. Tile disposal fields, such as are used with
septic tanks, and earth-pit privies accomplish this if the water table
remains several feet below the surface and if the location is remote
from water supplies. Cesspools and other types of pits do not ordinarily
confine contamination to their immediate vicinity and are not
recommended except for special conditions.</p>

<p>Sewage or other wastes discharged into abandoned wells or other
pits that reach to the water table or below it are almost certain to
contaminate the ground water.</p>

<p>It is generally poor practice, and often illegal, to discharge wastes
into surface streams. Streams do not necessarily purify themselves
in 50 feet, 100 feet, or some other stated distance, as is commonly
believed. They do tend to purify themselves over long distances
through the action of sunlight, aeration, and other factors but may
not be safe for domestic use for many miles below the source of
pollution. Clear, sparkling water is not always safe drinking water.
Streams in agricultural communities are subject to many sources of
pollution and they are likely to become more contaminated as they
merge into larger streams.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="SEPTIC-TANK_SYSTEMS" id="SEPTIC-TANK_SYSTEMS">SEPTIC-TANK SYSTEMS</a></h2>


<p>Septic-tank systems, if installed and maintained properly, provide
the most sanitary method of sewage disposal for farmhouses equipped
with running water.</p>

<p>Ground water or rock close to the surface, lack of sufficient fall
for the sewage to flow by gravity, and too small an absorption area
for the effluent limit the satisfactory operation of a septic tank.
When these conditions exist, special advice should be sought from
a competent local sanitary authority. Adverse soil conditions can
be overcome if sufficient fall and space are available.</p>

<p>The five essential parts (<a href="#fig_1">fig. 1</a>) of a septic-tank system are (1) the
house sewer; (2) the septic tank; (3) the effluent sewer; (4) the distribution
box; and (5) the disposal field. In special cases a grease
trap (see <a href="#fig_11">fig. 11</a>, <a href="#fig_11">p. 19</a>) is added. To facilitate inspection and repairs
it is good practice to keep in the house a chart showing the location
of the tank and other parts of the system.</p>

<p>A septic tank does not necessarily purify the sewage, eliminate
odor, or destroy all solid matter. Its purpose is to condition the
sewage or domestic waste by bacterial action, so that it can be disposed
of in a more satisfactory manner.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 303px;">
<a id="fig_1"></a>
<img src="images/fig1.png" width="303" height="501" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 1.</span>&mdash;A septic-tank system.</div>
</div>


<p class="caption3"><a id="OPERATION"></a>OPERATION OF A SEPTIC-TANK SYSTEM</p>

<p>In a septic-tank system the sewage flows by gravity from the farmhouse
through the sewer into the tank, where it should remain at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span>
least 24 hours. While passing through the tank the solids are acted
upon by anaerobic bacteria, which work only in the dark and where
there is little air. The heavy particles settle to the bottom as sludge,
the lighter particles float as scum, and the remainder passes out of the
tank through the effluent sewer to the disposal field. The gas released
in the process escapes through a vent provided either in the <b>T</b> to the
house sewer or the effluent sewer.</p>

<p>A tank that is too small may fill up with solids in a short while,
because sufficient time is not allowed for breaking them down by fermentation,
or the sewage may be pushed right through into the
disposal field and clog it.</p>

<p>The effluent may contain even more disease germs than the original
sewage, and though it may be as clear as spring water it is far from
pure and may cause foul odors if discharged or allowed to pool on
the surface of the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span></p>

<p>The final disposition of the effluent into the upper layer of the soil
exposes it to the action of aerobic bacteria. These bacteria, unlike
those in the tank, need air and cannot work in saturated soil or live
much more than 3 feet below the surface of the ground. The "living
earth," or upper stratum, teems with these bacteria, which convert the
dangerous sewage and disease germs into harmless matter and thus
tend to purify the effluent if it remains long enough in the top layers
of soil before seeping into the subsoil and thence to the ground water.
Effluent discharged deep in the soil does not receive the benefit of this
purifying action.</p>

<p>Several types of septic tanks are in common use. The one described
in this bulletin is the single-chamber type, which can be built with
or without siphon. This should meet all average farm needs where
there are not more than 16 members in the household. It would be
advisable to consult the authorities of the State agricultural college
or local health department as to their recommendations because frequently
local conditions and larger establishments require special
installations.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="SELECTING"></a>SELECTING THE SITE</p>

<p>First install the tile disposal field where there will be least danger
of polluting water supplies, at least 100 feet from water sources if
possible and always at a lower surface elevation. This is of greatest
importance. Even though selecting a more distant location would
result in greater initial cost, it would be a good investment as protection
against diseases that might result from pollution of water
sources. The site should slope away from the house and away from
the source of water. Gentle unshaded slopes free of trees or shrubbery
are best. Root-free locations are important because the open-jointed
tile cannot be "rootproofed." Porous, well-drained, gravelly, or sandy
soil allows greater purification. Do not have the disposal field in
vegetable gardens, under roadways, in swampy land, in muck soils,
or in areas having rock substrata sloping toward the water supply.
Allow sufficient area, where available, to enlarge the field later if
needed.</p>

<p>The septic tank may be close to the house, but a more distant site
would reduce the likelihood of odors if leakage occurs. The tank
should also be kept 50 feet or more from any source of water supply
and at a lower elevation. It should not be placed under driveways,
pavements, or flower beds, as these would make it not readily accessible
for periodic inspection. Care should be taken to insure that surface
drainage from the area around the tank will not reach the vicinity
of the water supply.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="THE_HOUSE_SEWER"></a>THE HOUSE SEWER</p>

<p class="caption4">Material</p>

<p>Vitrified salt-glazed clay or well-made concrete sewer pipe and cast-iron
soil pipe are the standard materials for house sewers on farms.
Asphalt-impregnated fiber pipe, of a type designed especially for
house sewers, appears to be satisfactory for this purpose. Cast-iron
soil pipe with leaded joints should be used when the sewer is within
50 feet of a well or suction line from a well, within 10 feet of any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span>
drinking-water supply line under pressure, within 5 feet of basement
foundations, or when laid beneath driveways with less than 3 feet of
earth covering the pipes. When within 15 feet of large trees or shrubs,
the sewers should have root-tight joints.</p>

<p class="caption4">Size</p>

<p>For house sewers, 4- and 6-inch pipes are generally used. Where a
4-inch pipe is used, cast-iron is commonly recommended. Grades with
little fall require larger pipes. The large sizes are also less liable to
become clogged. Clay pipe is made in pieces 2 or 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet long, whereas
fiber-pipe sections are 4 feet long and cast-iron pipe 5 feet long, so
that there are fewer joints. The minimum number of joints is desirable,
as there is less danger of stoppage.</p>

<p class="caption4">Alinement</p>

<p>Run the house sewer in a straight line and avoid bends whenever
possible. Slight changes in direction may be made with one-sixteenth
or one-eighth bend fittings. For sharper changes of direction a manhole
or distribution box may be used. Changes in direction of more
than 45 are not recommended unless a manhole is provided. Clean-outs
are desirable within 5 feet of the septic tank where tanks are
placed more than 20 feet from the building and the sewer line is not
buried deeper than 4 feet.</p>

<p class="caption4">Establishing Line and Grade</p>

<p>The trench for laying the sewer is usually dug after the septic-tank
excavation has been completed and the elevation of the tank inlet
determined. A simple method of setting guides for the excavation is
illustrated in <a href="#fig_2">figure 2</a>.</p>

<p class="caption4">Digging the Trench</p>

<p>Start digging the trench at the tank end, so that rain or seepage
will have an outlet. Rounding the bottom of the trench to the shape
of the pipe and hollowing out basins for the "bell" ends allows the
pipe to rest firmly throughout its full length, permits full calking of
joints, and relieves the strain on them.</p>

<p class="caption4">Laying the Pipe</p>

<p>Begin laying the pipe at the tank with the bell end uphill. Joints
in clay-tile pipe are commonly made with portland cement mortar or
grout. Where root-proof joints are essential, sulfur-sand compounds
may be used or copper rings provided and used with cement-mortar
joints. Asphalt-mastic compounds, however, are more satisfactory.
For cast-iron soil pipe, lead is the standard joint material.</p>

<p>After the hub is pushed into the bell, oakum (or old hemp rope) is
packed with a calking iron or a piece of wood (<a href="#fig_3">fig. 3</a>, <i>A</i>.) solidly and
evenly in the joint to a depth of about half an inch to center the hub
end in the bell and to keep the joint filler from getting inside the pipe.
Oil, grease, or dirt on the joint surfaces should be removed, as it will
prevent joint material from sticking. <a href="#fig_3">Figure 3</a> shows the different
jointing methods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 439px;">
<a id="fig_2"></a>
<img src="images/fig2.png" width="439" height="408" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span>&mdash;Establishing grade for sewer. <i>A</i>, 2- by 4-inch stakes are set each side
of the trench at convenient distances <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>. Then a board is nailed
horizontally on the stakes at <i>d</i> at a convenient height above the bottom of the
trench, that is, the bottom of the sewer leaving the house. A board is nailed
likewise to the stakes at a the same height above the inlet to the tank that <i>d</i>
is above the bottom of the trench. Similarly, boards are set at <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> by sighting
from <i>a</i> to <i>d</i> so the tops of the intermediate boards will be in line. <i>B</i>, The
exact grade of the sewer is obtained by measuring from the grade cord with the
1- by 1-inch stick, shown in detail. The length of the stick must equal the
height of the board above sewer at <i>d</i>.</div>
</div>

<p>Bituminous, sulfur-sand, lead, and other commercial joint compounds
are poured while hot into the joint from a ladle (<a href="#fig_3">fig. 3</a>, <i>F</i>), and
when the work is well done they form a joint that is practically root-proof.
They are more expensive than cement mortar.</p>

<p>For molding hot compounds, a clay dike, or funnel, built about 3
inches high around the triangular opening at the top of the jointer
greatly aids in the rapid and complete filling of the joint space. A
hot joint must be poured continuously, otherwise a seam may develop
between successive pourings.</p>

<p>Bituminous compounds make a slightly elastic joint. A joint in 4-inch
pipe requires about <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> pound of compound and in 6-inch pipe
about 1 to 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> pounds.</p>

<p>Sulfur-sand joints are hard and inelastic. The compound is made
by mixing together equal volumes of ordinary powdered sulfur and
very fine clean sand, preferably the finest quicksand, and then heating
the mixture until the sulfur melts. A 4-inch joint takes about <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>
pound and a 6-inch joint about 1<sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub> pounds of the mixture. Commercial
sulfur-joint compounds also are available.</p>

<p>Soft pig lead or old scrap lead is suitable for lead joints on cast-iron
pipe. About <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> pound per inch of pipe diameter is generally required
for each joint. The lead is hot enough to pour when it begins to char
the paddle used to skim off the impurities. When it cools it must
be calked tightly to take up shrinkage. The calking should be uniform
around the entire joint and should stop when the lead is tight. Heavy
pounding or continued calking may crack the bell of the pipe.</p>

<p>It is easier to get good, joints when the pipe is in a vertical position.
Therefore, two lengths of pipe are frequently joined and are then laid
as a single unit in the trench. In using terra cotta pipe, this procedure
may be followed only when the joint is made with a mastic compound.
Cement-mortar joints cannot be used in such cases.</p>

<p>Before filling the trench, the sewer should be tested to detect
possible leaks. Earth free from rubbish and large stones should then
be tamped around and about 1 foot above the pipe.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="THE_SEPTIC_TANK"></a>THE SEPTIC TANK</p>

<p class="caption4">Flow Through the Tank</p>

<p>Slow, undisturbed flow through the tank is necessary for the separation
of solids and liquids and for bacterial action. Submerged inlets
and outlets or baffle boards reduce disturbance. A submerged outlet
prevents scum from passing out with the effluent.</p>

<p>The single-chamber tank without a siphon, shown in <a href="#fig_4">figure 4</a>, is
easy to build, inexpensive, and entirely satisfactory in most instances.
In very tight soils or for large installations a siphon and sometimes
two chambers are advisable.</p>

<p class="caption4">Size</p>

<p>The tank should be large enough to retain the sewage at least 24
hours. The size should be determined by the largest number of persons
that may live in the house, rather than by the number actually
living there at the time the tank is built. The additional cost of a
large tank over a small one is relatively little. If there is any question
as to which of two sizes should be built, it is wise to choose the larger.
The dimensions recommended in the table in <a href="#fig_4">figure 4</a> are based on
an average production of 50 gallons of sewage per person per day.</p>

<p>Unusually large quantities of sewage call for a tank of large capacity.
In village and suburban homes where there is less food preparation
than on farms and where the number of persons is more or less fixed,
slightly smaller sizes will serve. In no case should the capacity of
the tank below the flow line be less than 500 gallons. A tank length of
two to three times the width should be maintained, and it is advisable
to provide a depth of at least 4 feet below the flow line.</p>

<p>Allow about 1 foot of "freeboard," or air space, above the flow line
for the accumulation of gases. This space is generally vented through
the soil stack of the house.</p>

<p>A siphon (<a href="#fig_5">fig. 5</a>) with a dosing chamber is not considered necessary
for a farm septic tank except for large installations (1,000 gallons
or more), for those in tight soils, and where the disposal field is limited.</p>

<p>The siphon provides intermittent discharge of effluent, which allows
time for the disposal area to rest and aerate between discharges. This
is more important where the discharge is nearly continuous than in
small installations.</p>

<p>The frequency and volume of the discharge into the tile field are
controlled by the sizes of the siphon and the dosage chamber. The
dealer should be informed of the size of the tank and the number of
persons in the household, in order that he may furnish the proper
unit. A 3- or 4-inch siphon will be adequate for almost any farmhouse
installation.</p>

<p class="caption4">Construction</p>

<p>Most septic tanks are built of concrete cast in place, since in this
way there is a minimum possibility of cracks developing. Concrete
blocks, however (not cinder blocks), stone, brick, or structural tile
are sometimes used. Prefabricated commercial tanks of concrete and
various other materials also are available.</p>

<p>Masonry units should be laid in full beds of 1:3 cement mortar and
the walls and floor plastered with at least a <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-inch coat of 1:2 mortar.
Cells of concrete blocks and tile must be filled with concrete. Masonry
walls are generally 8 inches thick, and care must be taken to follow
<i>inside</i> dimensions given for concrete tanks. Directions for laying
structural tile, brick, and concrete blocks can be obtained from dealers
or trade associations.</p>

<p>Commercial tanks are suitable if they embody the essential features
given in this bulletin. Capacities should be as recommended in <a href="#fig_4">figure 4</a>
 for concrete tanks. Proper installation and periodic servicing also
are essential. Tanks badly damaged in handling should not be used.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
Rapid corrosion of steel tanks will result if the asphalt coating is
impaired. Minor defects in precast masonry tanks may often be overcome
by plastering the interior with cement mortar.</p>

<p>A convenient method of assuring correct location of the tank is to
build a frame as shown in <a href="#fig_6">figure 6</a>. Care is necessary to aline it with
the center line of the inlet and outlet and to level it so that the distance
from the bottom of the 2 by 4's on the form to the lower edge of the
inlet hole in the form will permit it to be set at the grade of the house
sewer. This frame is used to support the form for the tank. To avoid
caving the edges, drive the stakes supporting the frame before beginning
the excavation. The lumber in the frame can be used later to
make part of the tank baffles.</p>

<p>Figure 7 shows how an inside form can be built and hung in place.
The inlet and outlet tees should be carefully set and tied in place before

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span>
the earth walls of the excavations will serve as the outside forms unless
the soil is sandy or gravelly and the excavation is deeper than 5 feet.
If outside forms are used, space must also be provided for them. Forms
should be constructed before the excavation is made and the tank
built as soon as practical, to avoid warping of forms and caving of
earth walls.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="THE_EFFLUENT_SEWER"></a>THE EFFLUENT SEWER</p>

<p>The effluent sewer should be constructed in similar manner and of
the same materials as the house sewer and on a slope of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch to
1 foot. This line, however, may be laid of terra-cotta pipe, as cast-iron
is not considered necessary except in unusual cases. This line
should always terminate in a distribution box from which the tile
lines of the disposal field lead away. For steep slopes the arrangement
shown in <a href="#fig_9">figure 9</a> (<a href="#Page_15">p. 15</a>) is practical. Joints must be of root-tight
construction if the sewer is in the vicinity of trees or shrubs. The
length of the sewer depends upon the distance from the tank to a safe
site for the disposal field.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="THE_DISPOSAL_FIELD"></a>THE DISPOSAL FIELD</p>

<p>Correct installation of the disposal field is of great importance
for proper functioning of the septic tank. Therefore, the width,
depth, and spacing of the tile trenches must be carefully selected.
Line of 4-inch, open- jointed, agricultural drain tile laid in shallow
trenches are ordinarily used. Perforated fiber drain pipes also may
be used and are obtainable in 4-foot lengths.</p>

<p>A distribution box with an inlet for the effluent sewer and an outlet
for each individual run of disposal tile is the best means of dividing
the flow. The outlet serving a large or double disposal field may be
alternately opened and closed by means of a sewage switch that permits
half the disposal field to work and rest alternately several weeks.
A switch is especially helpful in tight soils but should not be provided
unless proper maintenance is assured, so that a portion of the disposal
field will not be left to handle the entire load of the system for
an indefinite period. There are many variations of boxes, but <a href="#fig_8">figure 8</a>
shows a practical type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span></p>

<p class="caption4">Shallow Tile Lines</p>

<p>The disposal tile should not be more than 18 to 24 inches below
the surface, and where the ground-water level rises to the bottom
of the trench special underdrains, described on <a href="#Page_16">page 16</a>, are necessary.
Special provisions must also be made where tight soils are encountered.
These methods are described in the section entitled "Disposal methods
in tight or wet soils."</p>

<p>The table in <a href="#fig_9">figure 9</a>, together with the information given in table
1, below, may be used for estimating the number of tiles needed in
any particular soil type. If there is any doubt about this requirement,
a percolation test should be made in the disposal field, as follows:</p>

<p>Dig a hole 1-foot square and to the depth at which the tile is to be
laid. This depth in most instances will be about 24 inches and should
not exceed 36 inches. Fill the hole with water to a depth of 6 inches
and observe the time required for the water to seep away; divide
by 6 to get the average time for the water to fall 1 inch. The test
should be repeated at three or four different points in the disposal
field and the average time noted for all tests used. The data in
table 1 can then be used to determine the number of tiles needed.
Where 1 hour is required for the water to fall 1 inch the soil is totally
unsuitable, and another site should be selected. Soil conditions at
the time of the test may vary from year-round average conditions,
and this factor must be taken into account. If the soil appears exceptionally
dry, greater depths of water may be used or the test
repeated in the same hole. In no case should tests be made in filled
or frozen ground. Where fissured rock formations are encountered,
advice should be sought from sanitation specialists.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="DISPOSAL_METHODS"></a>DISPOSAL METHODS IN TIGHT OR WET SOILS</p>

<p>If the soil is heavy clay or has tight formation, yet shows some
porosity from percolation tests, the efficiency of the field may be increased
by placing below the tile lines 12 to 15 inches of additional
filter material (washed gravel, crushed stone, slag, clean cinders, or
clean bank-run gravel <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> to 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches in size). When the surface
soil is tight and is underlain by porous soil, sufficient drainage is
sometimes obtained for the smaller installations by omitting the tile
field and providing a dry well at the end of the effluent sewer, provided
the water table will not be contaminated. Larger systems under
such soil conditions should have a tile field, and absorption can be increased
by boring 6- or 8-inch holes down to the porous stratum and
filling them with gravel or sand; the holes should be 4 to 6 feet apart.
Another and perhaps the best practice is to excavate the tile trenches
4 to 6 feet and install a lower tile line, as shown in <a href="#fig_10">figure 10</a>. This
latter method is especially desirable if the upper tight stratum is
especially thick, or if there is no porous lower stratum, or if in irrigated
regions and where the disposal field is limited in area.</p>

<p>Where the underdrain tile is not used, the absorption capacity of the
field can be increased by providing a rock-filled trench across the
lower end of the tiles for the full width of the field. The depth
should be not less than 5 feet and the width not less than 3 feet.</p>

<p>On account of the beneficial action of bacteria in the upper soil layers
it is highly desirable to confine the effluent near the surface rather
than to use underdrains. Purification becomes slower and less effective,
the deeper the drains.</p>

<p>In situations where the soil contains considerable moisture or is
even saturated, the field may be improved by partially encircling it
with a tile line laid to serve as a drain. Such a line should be on the
high side and have surface outlets for removing the water from the
soil. It should not be laid so close to a disposal tile line that it will
drain the sewage effluent from the disposal field onto the surface of
the ground.</p>

<p>When the tile field is underlain by stratified rock or where under-drainage
is necessary, advice should be sought from the public health
authorities, as regulations in some States may not permit the use of
certain methods.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="CARE_AND_MAINTENANCE1"></a>CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF SEPTIC TANKS</p>

<p>A septic tank when first used does not need starters, such as yeast,
to promote bacterial action. A good septic tank normally requires
no maintenance other than a yearly inspection and an occasional
cleaning. Frequency of cleaning depends on the capacity of the tank
and the quantity and composition of the sewage. Tanks of the size
recommended in this bulletin may require cleaning at intervals of
3 to 5 years.</p>

<p>The tank should be cleaned when 18 to 20 inches of sludge and scum
has accumulated. If a drain has not been provided, sludge may be
removed by bailing or by pumping with a sludge or bilge pump. It
is not necessary to remove the entire liquid contents. Burial in a shallow
pit or trench with at least 18 to 24 inches of earth cover at a point
remote from water sources is the most practical method for disposing
of these wastes.</p>

<p>A septic tank is intended to handle sewage only. Coffee grounds
and ground garbage may be included if there is an ample supply of
water for flushing and the tank is cleaned more frequently than would
otherwise be done. The size of the tank should be increased at least
25 percent if these materials are included in the sewage.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b><i>Do not use matches or an open flame to inspect a septic
tank, as the gasses produced by decomposing sewage may
explode and cause serious injury.</i></b></p></div>


<p class="caption3"><a id="EFFECT_OF_DRAIN_SOLVENTS"></a>EFFECT OF DRAIN SOLVENTS AND OTHER MATERIALS</p>

<p>Soap, drain solvents, and other mild cleaning or disinfecting solutions
used for normal household purposes cause no trouble in the tank.
Constant use in large quantities, however, and disinfected wastes from
the sickroom may prove harmful.</p>

<p>Wastes from milk rooms, strong chemicals used in sterilizing equipment
or in photographic work, and the wastes from filters or water
softeners not only reduce bacterial action but also cause abnormally
rapid accumulations of sludge and clogging of the tile lines.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="PROTECTION_AGAINST_FREEZING"></a>PROTECTION AGAINST FREEZING</p>

<p>Septic-tank systems seldom freeze when in constant use. Warm
water and the decomposition of the sewage usually maintain above-freezing
temperatures. In cold regions there is trouble from freezing
if various parts of the system are not covered adequately. If the
system is to be out of service for a period of time or if exposure is
severe, it may be advisable to mound over the poorly protected parts
of the system with earth, hay, straw, brush, leaves, manure, snow, or
the like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span></p>

<p>In cold regions it is not advisable to install the entire system below
frost depth, as this will remove the effluent from the action of the
aerobic bacteria in the upper layers of the soil and make the system
generally less accessible.</p>

<p>New systems put into operation during very cold weather may freeze
unless large quantities of hot water are discharged during the first
few weeks.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="SEPTIC-TANK_TROUBLES"></a>SEPTIC-TANK TROUBLES</p>

<p>In sewage disposal, clogging of the disposal field is the most common
trouble. This may be caused (1) by a tank too small for the volume
of sewage, (2) by failure to clean the tank regularly, (3) by interior
arrangement that does not provide slow flow through the tank or that
allows scum or sludge to pass out with the effluent, or (4) by a disposal
field that is too small or is incorrectly built.</p>

<p>The remedy for a clogged disposal field is to dig up and clean the
tiles and re-lay them 3 or 4 feet to one side or the other of their former
position. Sometimes a tile line can be cleaned by opening up the
line at each end and flushing it thoroughly with a hose. With this
method provision must be made to drain off and safely dispose of the
water used for flushing.</p>

<p>Tile lines laid with improper slope allow the effluent to collect in a
limited area and saturate the soil, causing odors. Bacteria cannot
work in such areas, where the soil becomes sour, or "sewage-sick."
These lines must be relaid on the correct slope. Odors or a water-logged
soil may also indicate that the disposal field is too small.</p>

<p>House sewers frequently clog. This is due, in most cases, to roots
and less frequently to trash, garbage, or other foreign materials discharged
with the sewage. Greases in the sewer may cause trouble,
especially when the slope is insufficient to give the sewage a cleansing
velocity. Drain solvents will sometimes remove the obstruction, but
more often it is necessary to clean the sewer by rodding. In some cases
it may be necessary to dig up the line to reach the obstruction or, at
least, to open the line so that it can be rodded from two directions.
When it has been cleaned, a manhole could be built for use in case of
future trouble. If stoppage is due to roots it may be necessary to re-lay
the sewer with root-tight joints, or to move either the sewer or the
vegetation so that roots cannot reach the line.</p>

</div>


<p>Grease traps (<a href="#fig_11">fig. 11</a>) are not recommended for the average farm,
because they clog easily and require frequent cleaning, but they are
desirable for boarding houses and tourist camps where large quantities
of grease are produced. The septic tank if of proper design and
size will take care of the normal grease from most farm kitchens.</p>

<p>The traps must be several times larger than the quantity of greasy
water discharged into them at any one time, in order to allow the
greases to rise, but they should not be of less than 30 gallons' capacity.</p>

<p>The trap is best located in an accessible place in the basement or
under the house close to the source of grease and safe from frost.
Outdoor locations at shallow depths require a covering for insulation
against freezing. Grease traps should be connected to the kitchen

<p>When the farmhouse does not have an indoor toilet but does have a
kitchen sink or other similar fixtures, the drainage can be disposed of
as shown in <a href="#fig_12">figure 12</a>. Even where septic tanks have been installed,
it is sometimes advisable to have a second disposal field for other fixtures
than the toilet, to avoid overloading the tank, especially where
large quantities of laundry water are discharged at one time.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 12.</span>&mdash;Disposal of drainage from kitchen fixtures, using a line of terra
cotta or fiber drain tile surrounded with gravel. One or two rock-filled pits at
the end of the line increase the absorption area and are desirable where there
are several fixtures or the soil is nonporous. The pits may be lined with
boards or masonry laid without mortar and provided with a tight cover.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span></p>

<p>These wastes are not likely to create serious health hazards, but
they become nuisances if discharged promiscuously on the ground
surface. Such drainage should never be permitted on the watershed
of a spring.</p>

<p>Coarse sand and gravel, 12 to 18 inches deep, may be placed on the
bottom of the pit, to strain out small particles of solids, which might
clog the pores of the soil. If, after a few years, the sand or gravel
becomes clogged with solids, it should be replaced with clean materials.</p>

<p>If excessive quantities of grease are permitted to enter the sink
drain, a grease trap may be advisable.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CESSPOOLS" id="CESSPOOLS">CESSPOOLS</a></h2>


<p>Cesspools are cheap in first cost but high in maintenance costs and
often become nuisances. They should be located at least 150 feet from
wells, 15 feet from seepage pits and property lines, and 20 feet from
dwelling foundations. They should never be used in the vicinity of
shallow wells and, in any case, only where permitted by State
regulations.</p>

<p>The cesspool depends for its action upon seepage into the surrounding
soil and consequently is particularly unsatisfactory in tight clay
soils. In more open sand and gravel soils the seepage is reduced as
the pores of the soil become clogged with particles of solids, until it
stops entirely, and overflowing occurs. Emptying and then cleaning
the walls and floor of a cesspool do not fully open up the clogged soil
pores, and overflowing can be expected to occur soon again.</p>

<p>Solids in cesspools must be removed from time to time by bailing or
pumping and should then be buried 18 to 24 inches deep in a trench
where the water supply will not be endangered. Caustic potash (lye)
will to some extent liquefy solids in a cesspool. This treatment does
not eliminate the necessity of removing the contents when periodic
inspection shows that the cesspool is nearly full. Caustic potash
converts the greases into soft soap, whereas caustic soda forms a hard
soap that does not readily dissolve. The chemical treatment is not
effective in liquefying solids in the pores of the soil surrounding the
cesspool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span></p>

<p>When clogging continues and cannot be corrected, in most cases the
best solution to the problem would be to abandon the cesspool and
install a septic-tank system with tile disposal field. The cesspool
should be completely filled with stones, earth, or other solid materials
to avoid possible cave-ins.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<h2><a name="PRIVIES" id="PRIVIES">PRIVIES</a></h2>


<p>A privy when safely located and properly built and maintained is
satisfactory for its purpose on the farm. Privies should be built 50
to 150 feet from the farmhouse, preferably on the opposite side of the
house from prevailing winds, and at least 50 feet from the well. A
site downhill from the well is generally safest. In some cases, however,
the ground water may flow in a direction opposite to the slope
of the surface, in which case the privy should be built on the other
side of the well. Direction of flow may sometimes be learned from
soil surveys, well-driller's data, or other similar sources. A distance
of at least 6 feet from fences or other buildings allows for proper
mounding of the privy and keeps it away from roof drainage from
adjacent buildings.</p>

<p>Good, tight construction with screened ventilators keeps insects and
birds from entering, prevents rapid deterioration of the building, and
provides greater comfort for the user.</p>

<p>Certain features, while not essential to sanitation and satisfactory
service, add to personal convenience. A paved walkway, well protected
from cold winds and rain, is desirable. A neat, whitewashed
lattice, as shown in <a href="#fig_13">figure 13</a>, an arbor covered with vines, or a hedge
screen adds to privacy.</p>

<p>The earth-pit privy is the simplest to build and the one most widely
used. It is not generally recommended in localities where underground
rock has crevices.</p>

<p>For a sanitary type of privy with reinforced concrete<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> floor, riser,
and supporting sills see <a href="#fig_14">figure 14</a>. Because privy units are commonly
used as urinals, the use of impervious materials for risers and floors
facilitates cleanliness. In the colder climates, wood treated with a
preservative is durable and reduces the problem of moisture condensation.
Therefore, wood could be used if approved by the State department
of health.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> For information on making concrete see Farmers' Bulletin 1772, Use of Concrete
on the Farm.</p></div>

<p>When it is considered impracticable to build the slab and riser of
concrete, these parts may be of wood, as shown in <a href="#fig_16">figure 16</a>. The
building itself may be as shown in either illustration. A wood structure
is easy to move to a new location.</p>

<p>A pit with a minimum capacity of 50 cubic feet<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> will usually
serve five people over a period of 5 to 10 years. The privy should be
moved when the pit is filled to within 18 or 20 inches of the top
and a strong disinfectant spread in the old pit before covering it
with earth.</p>

</div>

<p>It is important to have the earth-pit privy more than 50 feet from
the well even where the water table is not near the surface. The
ground water should flow from the well toward the privy, and it is
important that this direction of flow be determined in advance.</p>

<p>Wood is most commonly employed for the main part of the building.
The ground outside should be sloped as shown, to shed water away
from the building, and the roof should extend beyond the walls to
shed water away from the pit.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="CARE_AND_MAINTENANCE2"></a>CARE AND MAINTENANCE</p>

<p>All privies require periodic attention. Seats and covers should be
washed weekly with soap and water or with disinfectants, such as
cresol, pine oil, and hypochlorite or chloride of lime. These have
deodorant properties and are available at most grocery or drug stores.
Druggists generally carry a more refined product and consequently
the price is higher.</p>

<p>During the fly season fly and mosquito eggs will be destroyed by
pouring half a pint of crude oil, crankcase oil, fuel oil, kerosene, or
borax solution (1 pound powdered borax dissolved in about 10 gallons
of water) over the contents of the pit about once a week.</p>

<p>Odors from privy pits and vaults can be reduced by covering the
contents with dry earth, ashes, manure, or sawdust. These materials
fill up the pit rather quickly, but can be used where other deodorants
are not available. Sometimes two cakes of yeast dissolved in 2 gallons
of water are effective in reducing odors. Commercial deodorants are
available from suppliers of disinfectants.</p>

<p>If a person in the family has typhoid fever or is a carrier of that
disease or has dysentery, it is advisable to disinfect the excreta.
Fire, live steam, boiling water, and such chemicals as caustic soda
(sodium hydroxide), caustic potash (potassium hydroxide), or hypochlorite
or chloride of lime may be used. The heat generated by the
slacking of quicklime is also effective. Best results are obtained if
the infected material is treated prior to depositing it in the privy.
Further advice may be obtained from physicians, local health officers,
or State health departments.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHEMICAL_CLOSETS" id="CHEMICAL_CLOSETS">CHEMICAL CLOSETS</a></h2>


<p>In general, chemical closets should be used only where there are
elderly or infirm people unable to get outdoors, particularly in winter-time.
In some localities their use is forbidden by law because of
improper maintenance. Strict adherence to the manufacturer's directions
for making the installation is necessary to obtain satisfactory
service. The chief advantage of chemical closets is that they may be
within or adjoining the house and used without regard to soil or
ground-water conditions. The caustic chemicals required, if used
properly, reduce the quantity of solid matter by liquefying action,
disinfect and deodorize the contents, and lessen danger from flies.
Disadvantages are the cost of the chemicals and necessity for careful
and constant maintenance.</p>

<p>The chemical-tank closet is generally recommended rather than
the dry-type chemical closet. Three variations of tanks are available
commercially. One type contains a clean-out opening in the top of the
tank, through which the contents are removed by pumping or bailing.
The second type has, in addition to a clean-out opening, a drain valve
at the bottom, which is operated by a handle extending to a clean-out
opening, so that gravity drainage of the tank is possible. The third
type is self-draining; as the excreta are added an equal volume of liquid
is spilled out the overflow. The solid matter must be removed manually
or through the sludge drain.</p>

<p>The last-mentioned type requires frequent addition of chemicals,
and the others are recharged after each emptying. The presence of
odor is an indication of insufficient chemical or of the need for emptying
and recharging. The same precautions apply to selecting an area
for disposing of the tank wastes as to disposing of the materials removed
from cesspools.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Since the contents of chemical closets are
caustic, they may kill vegetation with which they come in contact.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a>
 For disposal methods in tight soils, see <a href="#Page_16">p. 16</a>.</p></div>

<p>The dry-type chemical closet is cheap, simple, and easy to install
but requires frequent emptying. Pine tar and coal tar will accomplish
only partial disinfection and deodorization, but caustic disinfectants
produce liquefication in addition if used in sufficient quantities. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">« 25 »</a></span>
caustic chemicals may cause burns if the receptacle is too full or if
spilled where they come in contact with the body.</p>

<p>This form of closet is more of an expedient than a permanent installation,
and daily care is necessary to prevent the development of
insanitary conditions.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="DISPOSAL_OF_GARBAGE_AND_TRASH" id="DISPOSAL_OF_GARBAGE_AND_TRASH">DISPOSAL OF GARBAGE AND TRASH</a></h2>


<p>Domestic garbage and trash on farms can be divided into four
classes&mdash;(1) waste of plant or animal origin suitable for animal feed,
(2) unpalatable plant or animal waste, (3) combustible trash, and
(4) noncombustible material. The disposal of these wastes is simplified
if the four classes are kept separate.</p>

<p>Trash to be burned should be kept dry. Coffee grounds, tea leaves,
citrus rinds, fish heads, entrails, eggshells, and similar material are
most readily handled if drained and put in paper sacks.</p>

<p>Cans should be placed where they will not collect water and become
breeding places for mosquitoes. Cans will corrode faster if heated
sufficiently to burn off all grease. When the trash accumulates it
should be hauled to some out-of-the-way place, such as a gully, or
buried.</p>

<p>Neat-appearing garbage containers are desirable for kitchen use
and should be small enough to require daily emptying. Large containers
may be placed within easy reach outside the house and
screened with a lattice fence or shrubbery. Substantial containers
of rust-resistant metal will not quickly become an eyesore and a
nuisance. Tight covers should be used to keep out prowling animals
and to eliminate the habit of tossing wastes from the back door.
Open or wooden containers are not recommended.</p>

<p>A good way to protect the garbage pail is to place it in a small pit
that has a manhole frame and a lid that can be raised by foot pedal.
A gravel bottom in the pit will assist in draining water away.</p>

<p>Outdoor receptacles, if emptied and cleaned once a week, generally
do not become foul. Grease, coffee grounds, and other similar materials
that adhere to the sides of containers can be removed by
scraping with a little sand prior to scalding.</p>

<p>Electrically operated units grind garbage and bones and discharge
the material through the kitchen-sink drain. They will not handle
tin cans, glass, and the like. They may be used on farms if the
septic tank is larger than normal and if sufficient water is available
for flushing the drain to prevent clogging.</p>

<p>Garbage to be fed to animals should be preserved as carefully as
is human food. To prevent the spread of trichinosis and other
diseases, it should be cooked before it is fed to hogs. Garbage left
uneaten by the animals should be disposed of by one of the methods
described above.</p>

<p>Incineration is the most sanitary method of disposing of farm
wastes. Garbage, however, is not easily burned. <a href="#fig_16">Figure 16</a> shows a
type of incinerator<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> suitable for farm homes. Details of construction
for a brick incinerator are given in <a href="#fig_17">figure 17</a>. Brick, stone, concrete,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
or other fire-resistant material may be used. Commercial incinerators,
some of which are designed to be built into the house, also are
available, although these cost considerably more than the home-made
type shown.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Blueprints of this design may be obtained from the extension agricultural
engineers at most of the State colleges.</p></div>

<p>A limited quantity of refuse may be burned in a kitchen range or
a furnace, but it may cause accumulations of grease in the flue and require
frequent cleaning to prevent fire.</p>

<p>Next to burning, burial is the most desirable method of waste
disposal. Waste material may be deposited in a trench 3 or 4 feet
wide, 7 or 8 feet long, and 4 or 5 feet deep and covered with earth
when filled to within 18 inches of the top. If there is no fire hazard,
the contents of the trench may be burned.</p>

<p>Garbage may be included in a compost heap with leaves, peat,
manure, and similar materials. The compost pile should be in an
inconspicuous place, built up to the desired height with materials
that will rot, and then covered with 2 or 3 inches of earth. The top
should be level and the sides steep sloping. It is necessary that the
material being composted be kept moist; otherwise it will not rot.
Frequently commercial fertilizer is added to increase the fertilizing
value of the compost.</p>

<p>Ashes and clinkers removed from furnaces should be placed in
metal containers to eliminate fire hazard. Wood ashes may be spread
on the lawn or garden, as they have some fertilizing value.</p>
